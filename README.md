# SMART-MC and MSCOR: Reproducibility Repository

**Paper Title:**  SMART-MC: Characterizing the Dynamics of Multiple Sclerosis Therapy Transitions Using a Covariate-Based Markov Model 

This repository provides the necessary code and documentation for reproducing the results presented in the article above. It implements the **SMART-MC** model for estimating covariate-driven treatment transitions in Multiple Sclerosis, and introduces **MSCOR**, a novel global optimization routine designed for optimization over multiple spherically constrained parameter spaces.

## üìÑ Paper Summary

The manuscript introduces:

- **SMART-MC**, a covariate-driven Markov model for estimating dynamic treatment transition probabilities in MS as a function of patient covariates.
- **MSCOR**, a spherically constrained optimization routine for globally optimizing black-box functions over parameter spaces constrained to collections of unit spheres.
- A benchmark study demonstrating the superiority of **MSCOR** over existing global optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing.
- A comprehensive simulation study of **SMART-MC**, powered by **MSCOR**, evaluating estimation performance under various scenarios.
- An application of **SMART-MC** to real-world data to identify the influence of key clinical and demographic factors on both within- and across-treatment transition probabilities for MS-DMTs.

## üì¶ Requirements

- **R version**: 4.3.1  
- **MATLAB**: R2022a or later  
- **Required R packages**:
  - `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `patchwork`, `RColorBrewer`, `ggalluvial`, `reshape2`, `purrr`
 
### üïí Approximate Computation Time

For the case study involving 7 treatments, approximately 9,468 treatment records across 822 subjects, and \( p = 5 \) covariates, the SMART-MC estimation takes roughly **7‚Äì10 minutes** to complete. This benchmark was obtained on a **Windows 10 Enterprise** system with **32 GB RAM** and a **12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700** processor (12 cores, 20 logical threads, 2.10 GHz base frequency).
