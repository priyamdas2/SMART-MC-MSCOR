# SMART-MC and MSCOR: Reproducibility Repository

**Paper Title:**  
SMART-MC: Characterizing the Dynamics of Multiple Sclerosis Therapy Transitions Using a Covariate-Based Markov Model 

This repository provides the necessary code and documentation for reproducing the results presented in the article above. It implements the **SMART-MC** model for estimating covariate-driven treatment transitions in Multiple Sclerosis, and introduces **MSCOR**, a novel global optimization routine designed for optimization over multiple spherically constrained parameter spaces.

## ðŸ“„ Paper Description

The manuscript introduces:

- **SMART-MC**, a covariate-driven Markov model for estimating dynamic treatment transition probabilities in MS as a function of patient covariates.
- **MSCOR**, a spherically constrained optimization routine for globally optimizing black-box functions over parameter spaces constrained to collections of unit spheres.
- A benchmark study demonstrating the superiority of **MSCOR** over existing global optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing.
- A comprehensive simulation study of **SMART-MC**, powered by **MSCOR**, evaluating estimation performance under various scenarios.
- An application of **SMART-MC** to real-world data to identify the influence of key clinical and demographic factors on both within- and across-treatment transition probabilities for MS-DMTs.
