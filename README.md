# SMART-MC-MSCOR

# MSCOR
MSCOR can be used for global optimization of any non-differentiable/non-closed form non-convex/multi-modal function whose parameters belong to a collection of unit-spheres. MATLAB implementation along with a DEMO are provided.

# SMART-MC
SMART-MC is a framework, powered by MSCOR, for modeling temporal sequence data in Markov chain setup allowing the transiton probabilities to be estimated as a function of subject-specific covaraites. Rare transition probabilities are estimated as constants.
