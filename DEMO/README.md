DEMO Instructions:

1. Go to DEMO / MSCOR demo folder. MSCOR_DEMO.m demonstrates a practical example of minimizing a non-convex function
   (namely, modified Ackleyâ€™s function; see SMART-MC supplementary information for its exact form) using MSCOR.
   
2. Go to DEMO / SMART-MC demo folder. SMART_MC_DEMO.m demonstrates a practical example of SMART-MC estimation,
   backed with MSCOR, based on a dummy dataset.
